Kubernetes abstracts the storage through a __plugin layer__. The plugin layer is the interface that connects external storage with Kubernetes. The layer can mediate between any kind of storage, be it file based, bloc of object based, on-prem or cloud.

Most plugins are based on the __Container Storage Interface (CSI)__ which is an open standard.
