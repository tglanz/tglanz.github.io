A **k-uniform** hypergraph is a hypergraph such that the size of every hyperedge is exactly $k$.\n\nA **k-coloring** of an hypergraph is a mapping of every node to the set of colors $\\\\{ C_1, C_2, ..., C_k \\\\}$. A hyperedge is said to be **monochromatic** if all of it's nodes are of the same color. A hypergraph is said to be **k-colorable** if there exist a k-coloring such that there is no monochromatic edges.\n\n## Theorem\n\nIf $H = (V, E)$ is a k-uniform hypergraph such that $|E| < 2^{k-1}$ then $H$ is 2-colorable.\n\n## Proof\n\nLet $H = (V, E)$ be a k-uniform hypergraph such that $m = |E| < 2^{k-1}$.\n\nLet there be a random colorization of $H$ such that every node is mapped to either $RED$ or $BLUE$ uniformly and let $A$ denote the event the the colorization is proper (i.e. there is no monochromatic edge).\n\nIf we will show that $Pr(A) > 0$, then we can conclude that **there is** a 2-coloring, otherwise the probability was 0. We will work with the complement $A'$ and show that $Pr(A') < 1$ and therefore $Pr(A) > 0$.\n\nLet $B_e$ be the event that the hyperedge $e \\in E$ is monochromatic. It is true that $A' = \\bigcap_{e \\in E} B_e$. By the union bound: $Pr(A') \\leq \\sum_{e \\in E} Pr(B_e)$. The probability that a hyperedge is monochromatic is the same for all edges, therefore we can write $Pr(A') \\leq m Pr(B_e)$ (we abuse notation a bit, $e$ is some candidate edge).\n\nA hyperedge is monochromatic if either all of it's vertices are $BLUE$ or $RED$ - we will denote those events respectively by $C_{eb}$ and $C_{er}$. By symmetry, $Pr(C_{eb}) = Pr(C_{er})$ and the events are disjointed; therefore $Pr(B_e) = 2Pr(B_{eb})$.\n\nLet's calculate the probability that hyperedge $e$ is $BLUE$, i.e. $Pr(B_{eb})$. We will define yet other events $X_v$ indicating whether $v \\in V$ is $BLUE$. By our sampling definition, $Pr(X_v) = \\frac{1}{2}$ forall $v \\in V$. Because $X_v$ and $X_u$ are independent for all $u,v \\in V$, we realize that $B_{eb} = \\bigcup \\prod_{v \\in e} Pr(X_v) = 2^{-k}$.\n\nTherefore $Pr(B_e) = 2 \\cdot 2^{-k} = 2^{1-k}$ so $Pr(A') \\leq m 2^{1-k}$.\n\nBy the assumption that $m < 2^{k-1}$ we conclude that $Pr(A') < 2^0 = 1$ as we wanted.\n","html":"<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <nav class=\"toc\">\n      <ol class=\"toc-level toc-level-1\">\n        <li class=\"toc-item toc-item-h1\"><a class=\"toc-link toc-link-h1\" href=\"#hypergraph-2-coloring\">Hypergraph 2 Coloring</a>\n          <ol class=\"toc-level toc-level-2\">\n            <li class=\"toc-item toc-item-h2\"><a class=\"toc-link toc-link-h2\" href=\"#theorem\">Theorem</a></li>\n            <li class=\"toc-item toc-item-h2\"><a class=\"toc-link toc-link-h2\" href=\"#proof\">Proof</a></li>\n          </ol>\n        </li>\n      </ol>\n    </nav>\n    <h1 id=\"hypergraph-2-coloring\">Hypergraph 2 Coloring</h1>\n    <p>A <strong>hypergraph</strong> is the pair $H = (V, E)$ where $V$ is a set of <strong>hypernodes</strong> (a.k.a <strong>nodes</strong>) and $E$ is a set of <strong>hyperedges</strong> (a.k.a <strong>edges</strong>) such that every element $e \\in E$ is a non-empty subset of $V$.
