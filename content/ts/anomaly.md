# Concepts and Definitions

### Outlier Definition

> "An observation which deviates so much from other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was
generated by a different mechanism."

### Outlier Meaning

What is the meaning of a given outlier? For that meaning, what would we do with that outlier?

1. Meaning: Unwanted data. Aim: Data cleaning.
1. Meaning: Event of interest. Aim: Analyze the outlier.
